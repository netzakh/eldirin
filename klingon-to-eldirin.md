# Klingon to Eldirin

## General Principles

+ Most Eldirin roots are derived from Klingon in the sense that Klingon serves as the proto-language of Eldirin
+ However, the derivational rules are more or less those of Quenya derived from Common Eldarin

## Basic Klingon Roots

+ Basic Klingon root is *C1VC2* where
  + *C1* is one of *b ch D gh H j l m n ng p q Q r S t tlh v w y '* (21)
  + *V* is one of *a e I o u* (5)
  + *C2* is one of (same list as for C1) or *(none) rgh w' y'* (25)
  + *-VC2* cannot be *ow ow' uw uw'* (de jure) and neither *ew' Iw' Iy'* (de facto), which gives 118 Klingon rhymes
+ Basic Quenya and Eldirin root is **C1V1C2C3V0** or **C1V2V3C2V0** where
  + **C1**, **C2**, **C3** are consonants
  + **V1** is a short vowel, **V2V3** is a long vowel (if **V2** == **V3**) or a diphthong; 
  + **V0** is a short thematic vowel
  + Phonotactic rules are observed
+ In Eldirin, any vowel can be thematic, but typically **a** is used for non-adjective verbs, **ë** for adjectives, and the remaining three for nouns
+ Typically, a basic Klingon root becomes one or more basic Eldirin roots; it often happens that an extension from the form **C1V1C2V0** is needed; the options include (within phonotactics)
  + Doubling the second consonant
  + Lengthening the root vowel
  + Augmenting the root vowel to a diphthong
  + Adding another consonant to the second one, most often nasal, less often a liquid, rarely **s** or others
+ Klingon rhymes ending in *-Vw*, *-Vy*, *-V'* result in **C1V2V3**, which can then be expanded by reduplication of the initial consonant, or, less commonly, by another consonant
+ The rules here are just guidelines. Personal **lámatyávë** is applied.

## Vowels

Not unexpectedly, Klingon *a e I o u* normally become Eldirin **a e i o u**.

## Consonants

Only most common outcomes are listed.

| Klingon | as *C1* | as *C2* | Notes, Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| *b* | **v-**, **umb-** | **-mb-** | |
| *ch* | **ty-** | **-ty-** | |

| *j* | **ny-**, **indy-** | **-ndy-**, **-ny-** | |
| *l* | **l-** | **-l-** | |
| *m* | **m-** | **-m-** | |
| *n* | **n-** | **-n-** | |
| *ng* | **ng-** | **-** | Disappears medially: **fëo** "city" < *veng* |
| *p* | **p-** | **-p-** | |
| *q* | **ngw-**, **hw-** | **-ngw-** | |
| *Q* | **qu-** | **-qu-** | |

| *S* | **s-** | **-s-** | |
| *t* | **t-** | **-t-** | |
| *tlh* | **þ-** | **-ld-** | **þulda-** "drink" < *tlhutlh* |
| *v* | **f-**, **hw-**, **v-** | **-f-**, **-nw-**, **-v-** | |
| *w* | **w-**, **v-** | **-u+** | Forms a diphthong, with a possible root expansion  |
| *y* | **y-** | **-i+** | *-ey*, *-Iy* > **-í**; forms a diphthong or **í**, with a possible root expansion |
| *'* | **-** | **-(long vowel)+** | Forms a long vowel, with a possible root expansion |
| *-(none)* | N/A | **-ly-** | Typically expanded with **-ly-**: **celyi** "route, course" < *He* |
| *-rgh* | N/A | **-rd-** | |
| *-w'* | N/A | **-hw-** | |
| *-y'* | N/A | **-hy-** | |

## Non-basic Klingon roots

+ These are idiosyncratic, partially following the guidelines for the basic roots
  + The outcome is often an **-a** noun stem, ending in a consonant in the citation form
  + Examples: **veþþam** "ending of a book/story/play/etc." < *bertlham*, **ampar** "academy" < *'ampaS*
+ Note that a non-basic Klingon root may turn into a basic Eldirin one
  + Examples: **firyo** "cat" < *vighro'*, **lusquë** "school" < *DuSaQ*
  + The opposite is also possible, though very rare: **andyang** "enemy" < *jagh*
