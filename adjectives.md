# Adjectives

## General

+ Adjectives, unless used as verbs, are placed before the noun they modify
+ Adjectives are indeclinable
+ Most adjectives end in **-ë**
+ Examples: **ngwinyë firyo** "black cat", **tínë fëomi** "big cities", **cúpë Eldivan** "young elf (dative)"

## Adjectives and the Article

+ Formally, the article, if used, immediately precedes the noun: **ngwinyë el firyo** "the black cat"
+ Colloquially, **el ngwinyë firyo** might occur as well

## Adjectives as Verbs

+ Adjectives can be used as verbs (using the copula is not correct in such cases)
+ Examples: **hwallem** "we are smart", **panwes** "it is urgent", **el fëo tínes** "the city is big"
+ Imperatives end in **-p** (even for adjectives not ending in **-ë**): **hwallep** "be smart!"
