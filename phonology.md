# Phonology (and Orthography)

## Orthography

Quenya phonology, phonotactics, and orthography are used, so only differences are noted explicitly.

## Vowels

### Short Vowels

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`a~ə` | **a** | `ə` is used after the main stressed syllable
`e̞` | **e** |middle
`i` | **i** |
`o̞` | **o** |middle
`u` | **u** |

+ Short **e** and **o** are middle vowels, so the lowering diacritics in IPA is omitted elsewhere.

### Long Vowels and Diphthongs

All diphthongs are falling, and are considered long vowels.

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`aː` | **á** |
`eː` | **é** | mid-high, as in IPA
`iː` | **í** |
`oː` | **ó** | mid-high, as in IPA
`uː` | **ú** |
`aɪ` | **ai** |
`oɪ` | **oi** | `o` is middle
`uɪ` | **ui** |
`aʊ` | **au** |
`eʊ` | **eu** | `e` is middle
`iʊ` | **iu** |

+ **ui** is one syllable, not two
+ **iu** is _falling_ (_not_ `**ju`)

## Consonants

+ Special note: all palatal consonants are unitary, and are considered single consonants

### Nasals

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`m` | **m** |
`n` | **n** |
`ɲ` | **ny** | unitary
`ŋ` | **ng** | word-initial, word-final, or in `ŋɡ`, `ŋɡw`

+ **ng** is `ŋ` at the beginning or end of a word, `ŋɡ` otherwise

### Liquids

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`r` | **r** |
`l` | **l** |
`ʎ` | **ly** | unitary

### Voiced Stops

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`b` | **b** | only in `mb`, `lb`, `rb`
`d` | **d** | only in `nd`, `ld`, `rd`
`ɟ` | **dy** | only in `ɲɟ`
`ɡ` | **g** | only in `ŋɡ`, `ŋɡw`

+ `lb` is attested in some Quenya varieties, written _lambë-umbar_ in Tengwar
+ `rb`, the only Eldirin cluster not ocurring in Quenya, is to be written _rómen-umbar_ in Tengwar (not _órë_: `rd` uses _rómen_-based _arda_, so `rb` is to use _rómen_ as well)

### Voiceless Stops

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`p` | **p** |
`t` | **t** |
`c` | **ty** | unitary
`k` | **c** |

+ `k` is written **c** even before front vowels, but `kw` is written **qu** and `ks` is written **x**

### Voiced Fricatives and Approximants

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`v` | **v** |
`j` | **y** |
`w` | **w** |

+ `v` and `w` only contrast word-initially; otherwise, `v` occurs after vowels and `w` occurs after consonants

### Voiceless Fricatives and Approximants

IPA | Written | Comments
:---|:---|:---
`f` | **f** |
`θ` | **þ** |
`s` | **s** |
`ç` | **hy** | unitary
`x~h` | **h** | `h` word-initially, `x` otherwise
`ʍ` | **hw** |

## Phonotactics

### General Rules

1. The following consonants can occur word-finally: **m**, **n**, **ng**, **r**, **l**, **p** (rare), **t**, **c** (rare), **s**
1. The following consonant clusters can occur word-initially: **qu**, **ngw** (word-initial **ng** is a single consonant `ŋ`)
1. No consonant clusters are permitted word-finally
1. A long vowel (recall that this includes diphthongs) cannot be followed by a consonant cluster except **qu**
1. The following three-consonant clusters are permitted medially: **ngw** `ŋɡw`, **nqu** `ŋkw`, **rqu**, **lqu**, **squ**

### Two-consonant clusters

+ Some other clusters can rarely occur in compounds

1. Double consonants: **mm**, **nn**, **nny** `ɲː`, **rr**, **ll**, **lly** `ʎː`, **pp**, **tt**, **tty** `cː`, **cc**, **ff**, **þþ**, **ss**
1. Clusters with `j` and `w`: **my**, **ry**, **nw**, **ngw** `ŋw` (word-initial only), **rw**, **lw**, **tw**, **qu**, **sw**
1. Nasals/liquids with nasals: **mn**, **mny**, **lm**, **ln** (rare), **rm**, **rn**, **rny**
1. Clusters with voiced stops: **mb**, **rb**, **ld**, **nd**, **rd**, **ld**, **ndy** `ɲɟ`, **ng** `ŋɡ`
1. Nasals with voiceless stops: **mp**, **nt**, **nty** `ɲc`, **nc** `ŋk`
1. Liquids with voiceless stops: **rp**, **rt**, **rty** `rc`, **rc**, **lp**, **lt**, **lty** `ʎc`, **lc**
1. `s` with voiceless stops: **sp**, **st**, **sc**, **ps**, **ts**, **x**
1. Other clusters: **pt**, **py** `pç`, **ht**, **hty** `çc`
