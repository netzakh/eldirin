# Eldirin

A Quenya-like Klingon-based conlang. Just a conlanging exercise.

## Purpose

Sketch a Quenya-like conlang using Klingon as the proto-language (as Common Eldarin for Quenya).

## Disclaimer

This project has both a limited scope and a limited scale. In particular, no copyright infringement is intended:

+ The total number of Eldirin root words to appear in all articles here should not exceed 300; note that while most Eldirin words are derived from Klingon, there are also Quenya loanwords
+ The Klingon sources of Eldirin words are mentioned only in the Klingon-to-Eldirin article, and there are less than 50 words there; in other articles, Klingon sources are not given
+ Eldirin is not a mere result of fancy sound change rules applied to Klingon; in fact, Klingon roots are transformed with idiosyncratic adjustments, and then Eldirin grammar (which is much closer to Quenya grammar) is applied; in particular, Klingon suffixes are completely changed with numerous mergers, additions, and semantic shifts
+ Moreover, the correspondence between Klingon (or Quenya) and Eldirin features is deliberately not discussed
