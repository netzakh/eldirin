# Nouns

## General

+ Eldirin nouns change in number and case
+ There are two numbers: singular and plural
+ There are four basic noun cases: unmarked, nominative, accusative, and genitive
+ There are TBD other noun cases: dative, locative, instrumental, ablative, allative
+ In addition, possessive suffixes can be added
+ The citation form is the unmarked singular

## Noun Declensions

The declension depends on the citation form ending (i.e., on the stem) and on whether the object is sentient. The following stems are distinguished.

+ Regular vowel stems
  + Main type: **-o**, **-u** (not **-au**/**-eu**/**-iu**), **-i** (not sentient or **-ai**/**-oi**/**-ui**)
  + Special type: **-ë** stems, mostly non-sentient nouns with possessive suffixes
  + Special type: long vowel stems; the main difference here is in the stress patterns
+ Sentient short **-i** stems
+ So-called consonant **-a** stems, which end in a consonant in the citation form
+ Special **-n** stems, where the vowel before **-n** is short
+ Irregular nouns

In the **-a** declension a different stem can occur in forms other than the citation one (including **-ng** `ŋ` becoming **-ng-** `ŋɡ`).
Note that some nouns in **-ë** follow the "main type" declension, and some nouns in **-n** preceded by a short vowel have the **-a** declension.

## Plural Formation

+ Regular/main: non-sentient **-mi**, sentient **-mu**: **fëo** "city" → **fëomi**, **névi** "computer" → **névimi**, **Orcu** "orc" → **Orcumu**
+ Regular/special **-ë**: **-í** replacing **-é**: **névinyë** "my computer" → **névinyí**
+ Regular/long vowel: as in regular/main: **cú** "task" → **cúmi**, **reu** "citizen" → **reumu**
+ Sentient **-i**: **-ú** replacing **-i**: **Eldi** "elf" → **Eldú**
+ Consonant (**-a**, **-n**): **-i** with a possible stem change: **ampar** "academy" → **ampari**, **cilbas** "dog" → **cilbaxi**
  + Sentient nouns of this type might have **-u** instead of **-i**
+ Irregular: e.g. **mín** "eye" → **mindu**

## Basic Noun Cases

### Unmarked Case

In singular, this is the citation form of the noun.

+ The subject of an intransitive or indefinite-subject verb, even if placed after the verb
+ The subject and object of a transitive verb if the standard SVO order is used, unless emphasis is needed
+ The first noun in noun-noun construction unless emphasis or disambiguation is needed
+ After numerals and some other (non-adjectival) qualifiers; it is the numeral/qualifier which is declined
+ After prepositions

### Nominative

### Accusative

### Genitive

## Other Noun Cases

## Possessive Suffixes

See paradigms for details on stress and on possessive siffixes with consonant or long vowel stems.

For 1st person plural, archaic **-mm-** might occur instead of **-nd-**.

### Non-sentient Nouns

The resulting nouns are special **-ë** stems.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1st | **-nyë** | **-ndë** | 
| 2nd | **-lyë** | **-ldë** | 
| 3rd | **-ryë** | **-rdë** | 

### Sentient Nouns

The resulting nouns are sentient **-i** stems.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1st | **-nyi** | **-ndi** | 
| 2nd | **-lyi** | **-ldi** | 
| 3rd | **-ryi** | **-rdi** |
