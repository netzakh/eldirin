# Nouns

## General

+ Eldirin nouns change in number and case
+ There are two numbers: singular and plural
+ There are four basic noun cases: unmarked, nominative, accusative, and genitive
+ There are six other noun cases: dative, locative, instrumental, ablative, allative, essive (equative)
+ In addition, possessive suffixes can be added
+ The citation form is the unmarked singular

## Noun Declensions

The declension depends on the citation form ending (i.e., on the stem) and on whether the object is sentient. The following stems are distinguished.

+ Regular vowel stems
  + Main type: **-o**, **-u** (not **-au**/**-eu**/**-iu**), **-i** (not sentient or **-ai**/**-oi**/**-ui**)
  + Special type: **-ë** stems, mostly non-sentient nouns with possessive suffixes
  + Special type: long vowel stems; the main difference here is in the stress patterns
+ Sentient short **-i** stems
+ So-called consonant **-a** stems, which end in a consonant in the citation form
+ Special **-n** stems, where the vowel before **-n** is short
+ Irregular nouns

In the **-a** declension a different stem can occur in forms other than the citation one (including **-ng** `ŋ` becoming **-ng-** `ŋɡ`).
Note that some nouns in **-ë** follow the "main type" declension, and some nouns in **-n** preceded by a short vowel have the **-a** declension.

## Plural Formation

+ Regular/main: non-sentient **-mi**, sentient **-mu**: **fëo** "city" → **fëomi**, **névi** "computer" → **névimi**, **Orcu** "orc" → **Orcumu**
+ Regular/special **-ë**: **-í** replacing **-é**: **névinyë** "my computer" → **névinyí**
+ Regular/long vowel: as in regular/main: **cú** "task" → **cúmi**, **reu** "citizen" → **reumu**
+ Sentient **-i**: **-ú** replacing **-i**: **Eldi** "elf" → **Eldú**
+ Consonant (**-a**, **-n**): **-i** with a possible stem change: **ampar** "academy" → **ampari**, **cilbas** "dog" → **cilbaxi**
  + Sentient nouns of this type might have **-u** instead of **-i**
+ Irregular: e.g. non-productive formations like **mín** "eye" → **mindu** or suppletive plurals like **hot** "person" → **ronwo**, **lot** "thing" → **nyolyi** (some suppletive plurals are grammatically singular)

## Basic Noun Cases

### Unmarked Case (U.)

In singular, this is the citation form of the noun.

+ The subject of an intransitive or indefinite-subject verb, even if placed after the verb
+ The subject and object of a transitive verb if the standard SVO order is used, unless emphasis is needed
+ The first noun in noun-noun construction unless emphasis or disambiguation is needed
+ After numerals and some other (non-adjectival) qualifiers; it is the numeral/qualifier which is declined
+ After prepositions

### Nominative (N.)

Formation:

+ If U. ends in a vowel, then N. is formed by adding **-r**: **fëo** → **fëor**, **Eldi** → **Eldir**, **fëomi** → **fëomir**, **mindu** → **mindur**
+ If this vowel is long, then N. is stressed on the last syllable according to the stress rules: **Èldú** → **Eldûr** (formal), **nêvinyí** → **nêvinyîr** (formal and colloquial; note that the original stress remains as secondary)
  + However, if U. is stressed on the penult, there is usually no stress shift in colloquial: **Èldú** → **Èldúr** (but **formen** "north" → always **formêr**, same for the other directions)
+ Consonant **-a** stems in singular add **-ar** with the same stem change as in plural: **amparar**, **cilbaxar** (U.pl. ends in a vowel, so N.pl. is just U.pl. plus **-r**: **amparir**)
+ Consonant **-n** stems in singular lengthen the vowel before **-n** and replace **-n** with **-r**: **Èldirin** → **Eldirîr**, **vóren** "bird" → **vórêr** (formal) / **vôrér** (colloquial)
+ Irregular nouns behave "regularly": **mínar**, **lotar**, **nyolyir**

Usage:

+ The subject of a transitive verb when the order is not SVO.
+ The subject of any verb when emphasis is needed.

### Accusative (A.)

Formation:

+ As N. with **-n** instead of **-r**: **fëon**, **fëomin**, **Eldûn** / **Èldún**, **Eldirîn**, **lotan**

Usage:

+ The object of a transitive verb when the order is not SVO.
+ The object of a transitive verb when emphasis is needed.

### Genitive (G.)

## Other Noun Cases

## Possessive Suffixes

See paradigms for details on stress and on possessive siffixes with consonant or long vowel stems.

For 1st person plural, archaic **-mm-** might occur instead of **-nd-**.

### Non-sentient Nouns

The resulting nouns are special **-ë** stems. The plural of **-ryë** is **-rí**.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1st | **-nyë** | **-ndë** | 
| 2nd | **-lyë** | **-ldë** | 
| 3rd | **-ryë** | **-rdë** | 

### Sentient Nouns

The resulting nouns are sentient **-i** stems. The plural of **-ri** is **-ryú**.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1st | **-nyi** | **-ndi** | 
| 2nd | **-lyi** | **-ldi** | 
| 3rd | **-ri** | **-rdi** |
