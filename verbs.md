# Verbs

## Conjugation

+ Verbs are always marked for **number** and **person**, and can be marked for **reference point**, **aspect**, and **mood**.
+ There are two numbers and three persons (no dual, no inclusive/exclusive "we").
+ There are two reference points: past and non-past (called "present" for simplicity).
+ There are three aspects: indefinite (a.k.a. simple), perfect, and continuous.
+ There are three moods: indicative (default), future, and conditional; note that future is a mood in Eldirin.

+ Out of the possible 18 tenses, 8 are synthetical: all six simple aspect tenses and the present indicative in the other two aspects.
+ The synthetical tenses are referred to as follows.
  + Simple non-past tenses are referred to as present, future, and realis/conditional.
  + Simple past tenses are referred to as past, future-in-the-past, and irrealis/past conditional.
  + Perfect and continuous present indicative are referred to as simply perfect and continuous.
+ The perfect and continuous forms which are either past or non-indicative are analytical. However, Eldirin generally allows omitting either aspect or reference point/mood if both could apply; in such cases, the more relevant feature remains, and the less relevant one is determined by the context.
+ Thus, the analytical tenses are rare, and almost non-existent in colloquial speech.

A synthetical verb form has the following standard structure:    
verb stem + aspect/past suffix + basic ending + mood ending

## Aspect and Past Suffixes

+ Perfect: **-pu-**/**-hu-**, with the actual choice dependent on the the nearest consonants though both forms are correct
+ Continuous: **-li-**
+ Past: verb stem + **-ta-** + basic personal ending

## Basic Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1st | **-n** | **-m** | |
| 2nd | **-l** | **-l** | same for singular and plural |
| 3rd | **-s**/**-t** | **-r** | see below |

+ 1st person singular: in the future mood, the resulting form is **-n-** or (more often) **-v-**.
+ 3rd person singular: both forms are correct, and the actual choice depends on the the nearest consonants.
+ 3rd person singular: in the future mood, the resulting ending is **-y-** or zero.
+ 3rd person singular: in the conditional mood, the ending is zero. 
+ In some irregular and auxiliary verbs as well as in certain special cases, 3rd person singular ending is zero.

## Mood Endings

+ Future: **-ang** (**-ng** in 3rd person singular after the zero ending but not after **-y-**)
+ Conditional: **-tyu**, with the overall ending **-myu** in 1st person plural

## Other Forms

+ Imperative: verb stem + **-i** (non-adjectival verbs with stems in **-e-** and **-i-** turn these into **-Ã­**)
